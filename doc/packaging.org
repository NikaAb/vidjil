*Packaging Vidjil into a Debian Package
 **Requirements
   - The release version of Vidjil you wish to package
   - Knowledge of debian packaging
   In this documentation we will not go over all the specifics of creating a
   debian package. You can find the required information here:
   https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian
   and https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro?action=show&redirect=IntroDebianPackaging

 ** Creating the orig archive
 Debian packages use an orig archive to map a changelog. In order to create
 this archive for vidjil you must:

 Extract the release archive you wish to package:
  $ tar -xf vidjil-<version>.tgz
  $ cd vidjil-<version>/

 Download the necessary germlines and data files:
  $ mkdir browser # if it doesn't exist
  $ make germline
  $ make data

 Archive the folder as follows:
 Note that debian uses a different version annotation than vidjil, so it is
 likely that you will need to determine the correct annotation to use.
  $ cd ..
  $ tar -cvzf vidjil_<debian-version-annotation>.orig.tar.gz

 Make a standard compliant debian folder for the package (see documentation
 in Requirements section) and add the 'missing-sources' file (this is a
 workaround to the issue that Lintian cannot find the sources for some of the
 binaries included) with the following content:
  $ /browser/cgi/align.cgi
  $ /browser/cgi/similarity.cgi
  $ /algo/tools/similarity

 Commit the source changes (for some reason the dep.mk files need to be
 committed):
  $ dpkg-source --commit

 Build the package just like any debian package:
  $ debuild -us -uc

 You're done! You can now install the debian package with:
  $ sudo ``dpkg -i path/to/package
