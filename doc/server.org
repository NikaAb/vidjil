#+TITLE: Vidjil -- Server Manual -- Installation and Maintenance
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="org-mode.css" />

This is the preliminary help of the Vidjil server.
This help is intended for server administrators. 
Users should consult the web application manual.


* Roadmap: plain installation / Docker containers

There are two ways to install and run a Vidjil server:

 - The *plain installation of the server* should run on any Linux/Unix server with Nginx (recommanded) or Apache.
   We provide below detailed instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
   This is now the recommended installation.
   We use this installation on the public server ([[https://app.vidjil.org]]) since October 2014.

 - We are developping Debian packages as well as *Docker containers* to ease the installation and the maintenance.
   The Docker containers are currently tested in some partner hospitals,
   and we intend to release ready-to-use Docker containers in Q3 2017.
   This will then be the recommanded way to install and use Vidjil.

We recommand to people interested in installing a Vidjil server to wait until Q3 2017
and to use meanwhile the public test server.

* Requirements

** CPU, RAM

*** Minimal
   vidjil-algo typically uses
   approx. 1.2GB of RAM to run on a 1GB =.fastq= and will take approx. 5+ minutes.
   Therefore in order to process requests from a single user with a few samples,
   any standard multi-core processor with 2GB RAM will be enough.


*** Recommended
   When choosing hardware for your server it is important to know the scale
   of usage you require.
   If you have many users that use the app on a daily basis, you will need to
   have multiple cores to ensure the worker queues don't build up.
   One worker will occupy one core completely when running vidjil-algo (which is
   currently single-threaded).

   For reference, here is the current Vidjil setup we used on our public
   testing server [[https://app.vidjil.org]] during two years (40+ users, including 15 regular users):
      - Processor: Quad core Intel 2.4MHz
      - RAM: 16GB

   Given that the CPU is quad-core, we have 3 workers for executing Vidjil,
   keeping always one CPU core dedicated to the web server,
   even when the workers run at full capacity.

   As of the end of 2016, we use for the public server a virtual machine with similar capabilities.

   Running other RepSeq programs through the Vidjil server may require additional CPU and RAM.

** Storage

   As for many high-throughput sequencing pipeline, *disk storage to store input data (=.fastq=, =.fasta=, =.fastq.gz= or =.fasta.gz=)
   is now the main constraint* in our environment.

   Depending on the sequencer, files can weigh several GB.
   Depending of the number of users, a full installation's total storage should thus be serveral hundred GB, or even several TB.
   We recommend a RAID setup of at least 2x2TB to allow for user files and at least one backup.

   User files (results, annotations) as well as the metadata database are quite smaller (as of the end of 2016, on the public server, 3 GB for all user files of 40+ users).
   Note that even when the input sequences are deleted, the server is still able to display the results of previous analyses.
   Moreover, a future release at some point of 2017 will allow to access =.fastq= files on a mounted filesystem.

** Authentication

   The accounts are now local to the Vidjil server.
   We intend to implement some LDAP access at some point of 2017.

** Network

Once installed, the server can run on a private network.
However, the following network access are recommended:

 - outbound access
    - for users: several features using external platforms (IgBlast, IMGT/V-QUEST...)
    - for server mainteners: upgrades and reports to a monitor server

 - inbound access
    - The team in Lille may help local server mainteners in some monitoring, maintenance and upgrade tasks,
      provided a SSH access can be arranged, possibly over VPN.

* Installing and running the Vidjil server

These installation instruction are for Ubuntu server 14.04
These instructions are preliminary, other documentation can also be found in [[http://git.vidjil.org/blob/dev/doc/dev.org][dev.org]].
** With Docker
   All our images are hosted on DockerHub and can be retrieved from the
   repository [[https://hub.docker.com/r/vidjil/vidjil/][vidjil/vidjil]].
   Our docker environment makes use of docker-compose. All Vidjil components
   are currently packaged into a single docker image. Individual services are
   started by docker compose, such as in this [[http://gitlab.vidjil.org/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml][example]].
   
*** Versions
   - 1.1
   - 1.2
   - 1.3
   - 1.3.1
   - 1.3.2
   - tmp_fix
     This image is identical to 1.3.2 except it has a manual bugfix on pyDAL
     version 17.11 that was affecting the scheduler_workers.


*** Configuring the Vidjil container
   If you are using this environment for use on localhost, everything should
   work out of the box.

   However you may need to further configure the setup in order to make it
   available to a whole network.
   Here is a list of the configuration files found in the vidjil directory:
     conf/conf.js                             contains various variables for the vidjil browser
     conf/defs.py                             contains various variables for the vidjil server
     conf/gzip.conf                           configuration for gzip in nginx
     conf/gzip_static.conf                    same as the previous but for static resources
     conf/uwsgi.ini                           configuration required to run vidjil with uwsgi
     sites/nginx                              configuration required when running vidjil with nginx
     scripts/nginx-entrypoint.sh              entrypoint for the nginx
     service (not currently in use)
     scripts/uwsgi-entrypoint.sh              entrypoint for the uwsgi
     service. Ensures the owner of some relevant volumes are correct within
     the container and starts uwsgi

  Here are some notable configuration changes you should consider:
    - Change the mysql user/password in docker-compose.yml. You will also
      need to change the DB_ADDRESS in conf/defs.py to match it.

    - Change the hostname in the nginx configuration vidjil/sites/nginx_conf.
      If you are using vidjil on a network, then this might be required.

    - Change the default admin password. Login as plop@plop.com password 1234
      and go to the following URL: https://<your
      hostname>/vidjil/default/user/change_password

    - Change the ssl certificates. When building the image vidjil-server
      which creates a self-signed certificate for the sake of convenience to
      ensure the HTTPS queries work from the start, but this may not be
      acceptable for a production environment.
      In order to replace certificates the current method is to mount the
      certificates to /etc/nginx/ssl with docker volumes in
      docker-compose.yml.

    - Change the FROM_EMAIL and ADMIN_EMAILS variables in conf/defs.py. These
      represent the sender email address and the destination email addresses,
      used in reporting patient milestones and server errors.

    - Change the database password. In the mysql directory you will find an
      entrypoint script which creates the database, the user and set that
      user's password.
      This is the password  you need to match in the defs.py file in the
      vidjil configuration.

    - Change the volumes in docker-compose.yml. By default all files that
      require saving outside of the containers (the database, uploads, vidjil
      results and log files) are stored in /opt/vidjil , but  you can change
      this by editing the paths in the volumes.

    - Configure the reporter. Ideally this container should be positioned
      on a remote server in order to be able to report on a down server, but we have packed it here for convenience.

*** Updating a Docker installation
   Usually our docker installation will only require the following:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker pull vidjil/vidjil:latest
   #+END_SRC

   In some cases you may need to update your docker-compose.yml file or some
   of the configuration files. The latest versions are available on our
   [[https://github.com/vidjil/vidjil][GitHub]].

** Requirements
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    apt-get install git
    apt-get install g++
    apt-get install make
    apt-get install unzip
    apt-get install python-pip
    pip install unittest2
    pip install unittest-xml-reporting
    pip install enum34
   #+END_SRC

** Vidjil server installation and initialization
   Enter in the =server/= directory.

   If you just want to do some tests without installing a real web server,
   then launch =make install_web2py_standalone=. In the other case, launch
   =make install_web2py=.

   The process for installing Vidjil server together with a real web server
   will be detailed in the future.

** Detailed manual server installation and browser linking
	
	Requirements:
		ssh, zip unzip, tar, openssh-server, build-essential, python, python-dev,
		mysql, python2.5-psycopg2, postfix, wget, python-matplotlib, python-reportlab,
            python-enum34, mercurial, git

      If you want to run Vidjil with an Apache webserver you will also need:
            apache2, libapache2-mod-wsgi

      Or if you want to use Nginx:
            nginx-full, fcgiwrap


	For simplicity this guide will assume you are installing to =/home/www-data=

	Clone https://github.com/vidjil/vidjil.git

	Download and unzip web2py. Copy the contents of web2py to the server/web2py
	folder of you Vidjil installation
	(in this case /home/www-data/vidjil/server/web2py) and give ownership to www-data:

        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
	chown -R www-data:www-data /home/www-data/vidjil
        #+END_SRC

	If you are using apache, you can run the following commands to make sure all the apache modules you need
	are activated:

        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
		a2enmod ssl
		a2enmod proxy
		a2enmod proxy_http
		a2enmod headers
		a2enmod expires
		a2enmod wsgi
		a2enmod rewrite  # for 14.04
        #+END_SRC

	In order to setup the SSL encryption a key to give to apache. The safest option
	is to get a certicate from a trusted Certificate Authority, but for testing
	purposes you can generate your own:

        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
		mkdir /etc/<webserver>/ssl
		openssl genrsa 1024 > /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.key
		chmod 400 /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.key
		openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key
            /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.key > /etc/apache2/ssl/self_signed.cert
		openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text <
            /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.cert > /etc/<webserver>/ssl/self_signed.info
        #+END_SRC

        <webserver> should be replaced with the appropriate webserver name
        (ie. apache2 or nginx)


	Given that Vidjil is a two-part application, one that serves routes from a server
	and one that is served statically, we need to configure the apache to do so.
	Therefore we tell the apache to:
		- Start web2py as a wsgi daemon (allows apache to serve the application).
		- Reserve two virtual hosts (one to be served with ssl encryption, and one not).
		- We configure the first host to serve static content and prevent overriding
			by the sever (otherwise all routes are redirected through web2py) and to follow symlinks
			this allows us to symlink to our browser app in the /var/www directory and keep both parts
			of Vidjil together.
		- The second is set to use SSL encryption, and only serve very specific folders statically (such
			as javascript files and images because we don't want to create a controller to serve that kind of data)

	you can replace your apache default config with the following
	(/etc/apache2/sites-available/default.conf - remember to make a backup just in case): 

        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		WSGIDaemonProcess web2py user=www-data group=www-data processes=1 threads=1

		<VirtualHost *:80>

		  DocumentRoot /var/www
		  <Directory />

		        /home/www-data/vidjil/server/web2py/applications/$1/static/$2

		  <Directory /home/www-data/vidjil/server/web2py/applications/*/static/>
		    Options -Indexes

		    Require all granted
		  </Directory>

		  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/ssl-access.log common
		  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
		</VirtualHost>
        #+END_EXAMPLE

	Now we want to activate some more apache mods:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
		a2ensite default                   # FOR 14.04
		a2enmod cgi
        #+END_SRC

	Restart the server in order to make sure the config is taken into account.

	And create some symlinks to avoid splitting our app:
        #+BEGIN_SRC sh
		ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/browser /var/www/browser
		ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/browser/cgi/align.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin
		ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/germline /var/www/germline
		ln -s /home/www-data/vidjil/data /var/www/data
        #+END_SRC

      If you are using Nginx, the configuration is the following:
        #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
            server {
                listen 80;
                server_name \$hostname;
                return 301 https://\$hostname$request_uri;

            }
            server {
                    listen 443 default_server ssl;
                    server_name     \$hostname;
                    ssl_certificate         /etc/nginx/ssl/web2py.crt;
                    ssl_certificate_key     /etc/nginx/ssl/web2py.key;

                    }

            }
        #+END_EXAMPLE

        We also do not create symlinks since all references are managed
        correctly.

	Now we need to configure the database connection parameters:
		- create a file called conf.js in /home/www-data/vidjil/browser/js containing:
                  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
			var config = {
			    /*cgi*/
			    "cgi_address" : "default",
			    
			    /*database */
			    "use_database" : true,
			    "db_address" : "default",
			    
			    "debug_mode" : false
			}
                  #+END_EXAMPLE
		This tells the browser to access the server on the current domain.

		- copy vidjil/server/web2py/applications/vidjil/modules/defs.py.sample
			to vidjil/server/web2py/applications/vidjil/modules/defs.py
		  and change the value of DB_ADDRESS to reference your database.

	You can now access your app.
	All that is left to do is click on the init database link above the login page.
	This creates a default admin user: plop@plop.com and password: 1234 (make sure to
	remove this user in your production environment) and creates the configurations you can have
	for files and results.

	
* Testing the server
  If you develop on the server, or just want to check if everything is ok, you
  should launch the server tests.

  First, you should have a working fuse server by launching =make
  launch_fuse_server= (just launch it once, then it is running in the
  background and can be killed with =make kill_fuse_server=).

  Then you can launch the tests with =make unit=.


* Troubleshootings

** Workers seem to be stuck
   For some reasons, that are not clear yet, it may happen that workers are not
   assigned any additional jobs even if they don't have any ongoin jobs.

   In such a (rare) case, it may be useful to restart web2py schedulers
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   initctl restart web2py-scheduler
   #+END_SRC

** Restarting web2py
   Just touch the file =/etc/uwsgi/web2py.ini=.

   Another of restarting it is by touching the file
   =server/web2py/applications/vidjil/modules/defs.py=.
   This will tell =uwsgi= to restart web2py (including the workers).

** Restarting uwsgi
   When one modifies an uwsgi config file (usually in =/etc/uwsgi= directory, it
   may be necessary to restart uwsgi so that the modifications are taken into
   account. This can be done using
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   initctl restart uwsgi-emperor
   #+END_SRC

** Logging database queries
*** MySQL
    One can see some [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/650238/how-to-show-the-last-queries-executed-on-mysql][insightful SO post]].
    To summarize, this can either be done at runtime:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sql
    SET GLOBAL log_output = "FILE";
    SET GLOBAL general_log_file = "/path/to/your/logfile.log";
    SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
    #+END_SRC
    Or directly in the configuration file (less recommended):
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
    general_log_file        = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
    general_log             = 1
    #+END_SRC
    In that case the server must be restarted afterwards.
* Running the server in a production environment

** Introduction
  When manipulating a production environment it is important to take certain
  precautionnary mesures, in order to ensure production can either be rolled
  back to a previous version or simply that any encurred loss of data can be
  retrieved.

  Web2py and Vidjil are no exception to this rule.

** Making backups
  Performing an Analysis in Vidjil is time-consuming, therefore should the
  data be lost, valuable man-hours are also lost.
  In order to prevent this we make regular incremental (?) backups of the
  data stored on the vidjil servers.
  This not only applies to the fiels uploaded and created by vidjil, but also
  to the database.

** Autodelete and Permissions
  Web2py has a handy feature called AutoDelete which allows the administrator
  to state that file reference deletions should be cascaded if no other
  references to the file exist.
  When deploying to production one needs to make sure AutoDelete is
  deactivated.
  As a second precaution it is also wise to temporarily restrict web2py's
  access to referenced files.

  Taking two mesures to prevent file loss might seem like overkill, but
  securing data is more important than the small amount of extra time spent
  putting these mesures into place.

** Deploying the server
  Currently deploying changes to production is analogous to merging into the
  rbx branch and pulling from the server.

  Once this has been done, it is important that any database migrations have
  been applied.
  This can be verified by refreshing the server (calling a controller) and
  then looking at the database.


** Step by Step
  - Set AutoDelete to False
  - Check permissions on the uploads folder (set to 100)
    - you can also check the amount of files present at this point for future
      reference
  - Backup database: Archive old backup.csv and then from admin page: backup
    db
  - pull rbx (if already merged dev)
  - Check the database (for missing data or to ensure mmigrations have been
        applied)
  - Check files to ensure no files are missing
  - Reset the folder permissions on uploads (755 seems to be the minimum
    requirement for web2py)
  - Run unit tests (Simply a precaution: Continuous Integration renders this
    step redundant but it's better to be sure)
  - Check site functionnality

* Resetting user passwords
  Currently there is not easy way of resetting a user's password.
  The current method is the following:
  `cd server/web2py`
  `python web2py -S vidjil -M`
  `db.auth_user[<user-id].update_record(password=CRYPT(key=auth.settings.hmac_key)('<password>')[0],reset_password_key='')`

* Migrating Data
** Database
   The easiest way to perform a database migration is to first extract the
   data with the following command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mysqldump -u <user> -p <db> -c --no-create-info > <file>
   #+END_SRC

   An important element to note here is the --no-create-info we add this
   parameter because web2py needs to be allowed to create tables itself
   because it keeps track of database migrations and errors will occur if
   tables exist which it considers it needs to create.

   In order to import the data into an installation you first need to ensure
   the tables have been created by Web2py this can be achieved by simply
   accessing a non-static page.

   /!\ If the database has been initialised from the interface you will
   likely encounter primary key collisions or duplicated data, so it is best
   to skip the initialisation altogether.

   Once the tables have been created, the data can be imported as follows:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mysql -u <user> -p <db> < <file>
   #+END_SRC

   Please note that with this method you should have at least one admin user
   that is accessible in the imported data. Since the initialisation is being
   skipped, you will not have the usual admin account present.
   It is also possible to create a user directly from the database although
   this is not the recommended course of action.

** Files
   Files can simply be copied over to the new installation, their filenames
   are stored in the database and should therefore be accessible as long as
   they are in the correct directories.

** Filtering data (soon deprecated)
   When extracting data for a given user, the whole database should not be
   copied over.
   There are two courses of action:
     - create a copy of the existing database and remove the users that are
       irrelevant. The cascading delete should remove any unwanted data
       barring a few exceptions (notably fused_file, groups and sample_set_membership)

     - export the relevant data directly from the database. This method
       requires multiple queries which will not be detailed here.

  Once the database has been correctly extracted, a list of files can be
  obtained from sequence_file, fused_file, results_file and analysis_file
  with the following query:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sql
    SELECT <filename field>
    FROM <table name>
    INTO OUTFILE 'filepath'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    ENCLOSED BY ''
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
  #+END_SRC

  Note: We are managing filenames here which should not contain any
  character such as quotes or commas so we can afford to refrain from
  enclosing the data with quotes.

  This query will output a csv file containing a filename on each line.
  Copying the files is now just a matter of running the following script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sh copy_files <file source> <file destination> <input file>
#+END_SRC

** Exporting sample sets
   The migrator script allows the export and import of data, whether it be a
   single patient/run/set or a list of them, or even all the sample sets
   associated to a group.
